This is an adaptation of the HealPix java sources found here:
https://healpix.sourceforge.io/

Significant changes:
* Movement of all modules from `healpix.essential` -> `healpix`
* Transition to gradle + normal Java file structure
* Cleanup thanks to spotless and errorprone tools

Installation of Healpix Java
----------------------------
